Hashmap is part of Java's Collection since java 1.2. Found in java.util package

It provides a basic implementation of Map interface of Java. HashMap stores the data in (Key, Value) pairs and can be accessed by index of another type.
One object is used as a key(index) to another Object (value).

If we try to insert the duplicate key in hashmap, it will replace element of corresponding key.

HashMap is similar to HashTable but it is unsynchronized.

Allows to store the null keys as well, but there should be only one null key object.

No order is maintained in map.


public class Hashmap<K, V> extends AbstractMap<K, V> implements Cloneable, Serializable

Keys im hashmap is valid if it implements hashcode(), and equal() Methods.
